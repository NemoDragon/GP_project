# Genetic Programming Project

The project is an implementation of a software that modifies programs written in our own  language: GPL (Genetic Programming Language), so that these programs can solve given problems. It generates a population which changes in the process of an evolution. 
For modifying programs it uses genetic algorithms such as:
- selection (tournament or roulette)
- mutation
- crossover 

During evolution in each epoch the program prints results in a console, saves results to files and shows diagrams.
